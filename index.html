            A frequently asked questions page—or an FAQ page for
             short—is a key part of a knowledge base because it
              addresses your customers' most common questions and is
               useful at all stages of the customer journey. FAQs start with
                a question and then provide a concise answer.Dec 8, 2023

            10-20 questions<br>
            How many questions should an FAQ have? It depends on the product/service, complexity, and target audience. It's important to cover the most important question on how to use the product/service, set it up, and answer customers' most common questions. A FAQ with 10-20 questions should be sufficient to cover the basics.
